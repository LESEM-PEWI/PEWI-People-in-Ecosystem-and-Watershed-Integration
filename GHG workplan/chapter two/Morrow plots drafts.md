In the context of global changes, such as climate change, process-based models are crucial for gaining a comprehensive understanding of key management practices and their interaction with the physical environment. Our research has contributed to a better understanding of how the APSIM model predicts Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in the US Midwest. Our work has built upon previous studies that assessed APSIM in this region, covering areas such as crop yield simulations (Archontoulis et al., 2020; Archontoulis et al., 2014), long-term impacts of nitrogen on crop yields (Puntel et al., 2016), cover crop simulations (Basche et al., 2016), and predictions of nitrate leaching (Malone et al., 2007). As emphasized by Tonitto et al. (2018), it is crucial to evaluate the overall model performance across multiple aspects, as accurate predictions for one process, such as crop yields, may not necessarily extend to accurate predictions for other processes like SOC (Mohanty et al., 2020). Therefore, it is essential to validate process-based models across various agroecosystem processes to address diverse agroecosystem management goals effectively.

In an era of rapid global changes, such as climate change, the role of process-based models in understanding and predicting the complex dynamics between management practices and the physical environment cannot be overstated. Process-based models are appealing due to their ability to integrate various components into one modeling environment, which provides a convenient and cost-effective way to predict a wide range of environmental services and crop production. As Tonitto et al. (2018) highlighted, the performance of process-based models must be evaluated holistically across a spectrum of agroecosystem processes. This is because accurate predictions in one domain, such as crop yields, do not necessarily guarantee precision in others, like SOC dynamics (Mohanty et al., 2020). Our research has responded to this call by comprehensively understanding APSIM SOC prediction capability in the U.S. Midwest. Our study complements existing research that has evaluated APSIM on various aspects in this region, including crop yield simulations (Archontoulis et al., 2020; Archontoulis et al., 2014), long-term N impacts on crop yields (Puntel et al., 2016), cover crop simulations (Basche et al., 2016), and nitrate leaching predictions (Malone et al., 2007). This is crucial for ensuring that APSIM can effectively support diverse agroecosystem management goals in the face of evolving environmental challenges.

Our work underscores the importance of this comprehensive validation approach. By scrutinizing APSIM’s predictions of SOC alongside its proven capabilities in other areas, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the model’s strengths and limitations. This holistic validation is crucial for improving model accuracy and ensuring that these models can effectively

made significant strides in advancing the understanding of how the APSIM model forecasts Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) dynamics in the U.S. Midwest, a region of paramount importance for global agricultural productivity. Building on the foundation laid by earlier studies that focused on crop yield simulations (Archontoulis et al., 2020; Archontoulis et al., 2014), the long-term impacts of nitrogen on crop productivity (Puntel et al., 2016), cover crop efficacy (Basche et al., 2016). Nitrate leaching predictions (Malone et al., 2007), our study delves deeper into the model's capacity to predict SOC—a key indicator of soil health and sustainability.

These findings underscore the critical role of crop residue retention in replenishing SOC stocks in row crop fields. Although synthetic N enhances crop residue yield <span style="color: black;">(Taylor et al., 2021)</span>, the effect of high N rate on SOC is variable, even in cases where all crop residues are retained at the production site (Khan et al., 2007; Poffenbarger et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2020). This is because high levels of synthetic N can deplete soil N and carbon (C) (Mulvaney et al., 2009), which suggests that high N rates can offset the impacts of high residue on SOC. Faster residue breakdown under high N conditions has been reported by both laboratory and field experiments (Green et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2014). However, information on combinations of N rates with different residue removal rates or fertilizer application types and their impacts on SOC is scarce.
