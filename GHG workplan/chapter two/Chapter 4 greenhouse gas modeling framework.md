Evaluation of policy instruments for supporting greenhouse gas mitigation efforts in agricultural and urban land use

In many studies, methods or frameworks have been presented for the assessment and selection of policy instruments for climate change mitigation or adaptation, or for environmental management in general ( Böcher, 2012 ; Mees et al., 2014 ; Di Gregorio et al., 2017 ). Policy instruments have usually been evaluated using single criteria, such as cost-efficiency, or the studies have been concentrated on single policies (e.g. Bakam et al., 2012 ). Coherence in climate change adaptation or mitigation has also been commonly addressed in previous studies ( Mickwitz et al., 2009 ; England et al., 2018 ; Lankoski et al., 2018 ). However, to our knowledge, no holistic evaluation of the performance of policy instruments promoting the practical measures for the reduction of GHG emissions has been published from the experts’ point of view in the LULUCF sector.

The aim of our study is to increase understanding on the performance of policy instruments intended to promote efforts for the reduction of GHG emissions in the LULUCF sector. This was done by analysing experts’ views on the most important policy instruments and identifying the criteria which experts use when evaluating policy instruments related to climate change mitigation in agricultural and urban land use in Finland. Furthermore, this included a consideration of experts’ views on the coherence of these instruments within agricultural and agri-environmental policy and between agricultural and agri-environmental policy and other policies in Finland. Experts with different backgrounds, specific competences and various experiences on policy effects are expected to provide important views on the performance of policy instruments.

## Building virtual cities, inspiring intelligent citizens: Digital games for developing students’ problem solving and learning motivation

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.012

This study investigates the effectiveness digital game-based learning (DGBL) on students’ problem solving, learning motivation, and academic achievement. In order to provide substantive empirical evidence, a quasi-experimental design was implemented over the course of a full semester (23 weeks). Two ninth-grade Civics and Society classes, with a total of 44 students (15–16 years old), were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: an experimental group (incorporating DGBL) and a comparison group (taught using traditional instruction). Two-way mixed ANOVA was employed to evaluate changes in problem solving ability and compare the effectiveness the two strategies, while ANCOVA was used to analyze the effects on learning motivation and academic achievement. The results of this study are summarized as follows: (1) The DGBL strategy was clearly effective in promoting students’ problem solving skills, while the control group showed no improvement. Additionally, data from the mid-test and post-test demonstrate that, as a higher order thinking skill, problem-solving requires a full semester to develop. (2). DGBL resulted in better learning motivation for students in the experimental group as compared to learners receiving TI. (3) Contrary to some suggestions that digital games could inhibit academic achievement, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups. Most importantly, the quantitative improvement in problem-solving and learning motivation suggest that DGBL can be exploited as a useful and productive tool to support students in effective learning while enhancing the classroom atmosphere. Future research in DGBL should emphasize the evaluation of other higher order elements of the cognitive domain in terms of academic achievement outcomes and skills, such as critical and creative thinking.

Although there are several approaches to teaching and learning, there has been some consensus amongst educationists that some complex topics involving various components can be better handled by digital-game-based learning tools, which are grounded in congitive and motivation theories (Krath et al 2021). DGBL tools are designed to be able to engage learners on complex learning topics, and if possible present information with varying levels of difficulty (Mayer et al 2010).

# Natural climate solutions

https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710465114  
GRISCOM ET AL 2017

The most effective method for removing carbon dioxide is enhanced land stewardship, yet there is still confusion regarding the specific actions needed to increase carbon sinks and decrease emissions from land use activities. https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aam9726

Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris ClimateAgreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, con-fusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship optionsavailable and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identifyand quantify “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, res-toration, and improved land management actions that increase car-bon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across globalforests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find thatthe maximum potential of NCS—when constrained by food security,fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23.8 petagrams ofCO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y−1 (95% CI 20.3–37.4). This is ≥30% higherthan prior estimates, which did not include the full range of optionsand safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3PgCO2e y−1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assumingthe social cost of CO2 pollution is ≥100 USD MgCO2e−1 by 2030.Natural climate solutions can provide 37% of cost-effective CO2 mit-igation needed through 2030 for a >66% chance of holding warm-ing to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation canbe delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2−1. Most NCS actions—ifeffectively implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffer-ing, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience.Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation es-timates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides arobust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystemstewardship as a major solution to climate change

# Contribution of the land sector to a 1.5 °C world

Land-based mitigation measures largely fall into four categories: reduced land-use change, CDR through enhanced carbon sinks, reduced agricultural emissions, and reduced overall production through demand shifts. Most countries included reduced land-use change, afforestation and forest restoration, a few included soil carbon sequestration and reduced agricultural emissions, yet none mentioned demand-side shifts.

# Strategies for Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agricultural Ecosystems

Climate change, driven by rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere, poses serious and wide-ranging threats to human societies and natural ecosystems all over the world. Agriculture and forestry account for roughly one-third of global emissions, including 9 to 14% of GHGs from crop and livestock activities. Due to increasing demand based on human population and income growth and dietary change, GHG emissions are likely to increase by about 76% by 2050 relative to the levels in 1995. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are the major GHGs contributed from the agricultural sector, contributing 50 and 70%, respectively, to the total levels. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are mainly contributed by a change in land use patterns and decomposition of organic materials. Global emission pathways that would limit warming to 1.5 °C or less, in line with the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal, depend on significant reductions in agricultural GHGs (N2O and CH4) as well as net zero CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. As the agricultural sector mainly contributes to N2O and CH4, 4.8 Gt CO2-eq reduction in direct global agricultural non-CO2 emissions below baseline by 2050 is needed. These ambitious targets of mitigation pathways present an enormous challenge, and accomplishment of these goals is only possible by the implementation of effective GHG mitigation strategies to the agricultural sector. Mitigation measures in the agricultural sector include increasing C sequestration as well as reduction in the GHGs from livestock and agricultural processes. In this chapter, we discussed mitigation strategies for GHG emissions from the agricultural sector at the global scale.

With the development of society and intensified human activities, the use of fossil fuels and changes in land use have led to an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and global climate warming. Climate warming results in rising sea levels, a sharp decline in biodiversity, and ecological degradation, significantly impacting agriculture and forestry (Alhamid et al., 2022). In China, greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production account for a significant proportion of the total emissions (Zhang et al., 2022). Research has found that China's agricultural greenhouse gas emissions reached 1.58 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in 2009, an increase of 52.03% compared to 1980. Forests play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global climate warming. Studies have shown that the carbon sequestration rates for building new forests and protecting existing forests range from 0.04 to 7.52 and 0.33–5.20 tons of carbon per hectare per year (Chang et al., 2022).

&nbsp;

Climate change, primarily driven by human activities, has become one of the most urgent global challenges (Anderegg et al., 2020). The rise in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), has significantly disrupted the Earth's energy balance, resulting in widespread changes in weather patterns, increasing global temperatures, and unprecedented environmental impacts (Gupta et al., 2023; Biermann et al., 2012; Abrahms et al., 2023; Bellassen et al., 2022). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has unequivocally emphasized the role of human-induced GHG emissions in propelling climate change, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive research to comprehend the intricate linkages between climate change and GHG emissions (Change, 2007). The effects of climate change are extensive and varied, including ecosystem shifts, sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and disruptions in agriculture and water resources. These consequences pose significant risks to human societies, biodiversity, and the overall stability of our planet's ecosystems (Zurek et al., 2022). It's crucial to recognize that climate change is not an isolated event but rather a complex web of interactions, with GHG emissions playing a vital role in intensifying the scale and pace of global warming (Ogar et al., 2020).

# Towards a global-scale soil climate mitigation strategy

## Abstract

Sustainable soil carbon sequestration practices need to be rapidly scaled up and implemented to contribute to climate change mitigation. We highlight that the major potential for carbon sequestration is in cropland soils, especially those with large yield gaps and/or large historic soil organic carbon losses. The implementation of soil carbon sequestration measures requires a diverse set of options, each adapted to local soil conditions and management opportunities, and accounting for site-specific trade-offs. We propose the establishment of a soil information system containing localised information on soil group, degradation status, crop yield gap, and the associated carbon-sequestration potentials, as well as the provision of incentives and policies to translate management options into region- and soil-specific practices.

# Challenges of accounting nitrous oxide emissions from

# agricultural crop residues

### abstract

Crop residues are important inputs of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) to soils and thus  
directly and indirectly affect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. As the current inventory  
methodology considers N inputs by crop residues as the sole determining factor for  
N2O emissions, it fails to consider other underlying factors and processes. There is  
compelling evidence that emissions vary greatly between residues with different biochemical and physical characteristics, with the concentrations of mineralizable N and  
decomposable C in the residue biomass both enhancing the soil N2O production potential. High concentrations of these components are associated with immature residues (e.g., cover crops, grass, legumes, and vegetables) as opposed to mature residues  
(e.g., straw). A more accurate estimation of the short-term (months) effects of the  
crop residues on N2O could involve distinguishing mature and immature crop residues  
with distinctly different emission factors. The medium-term (years) and long-term (decades) effects relate to the effects of residue management on soil N fertility and  
soil physical and chemical properties, considering that these are affected by local climatic and soil conditions as well as land use and management. More targeted mitigation efforts for N2O emissions, after addition of crop residues to the soil, are urgently  
needed and require an improved methodology for emission accounting. This work  
needs to be underpinned by research to (1) develop and validate N2O emission factors for mature and immature crop residues, (2) assess emissions from belowground  
residues of terminated crops, (3) improve activity data on management of different  
residue types, in particular immature residues, and (4) evaluate long-term effects of  
residue addition on N2O emissions.

# Using Game-based Learning to Facilitate Attitude Change for Environmental Sustainability

Environmental Sustainability Education (ESE) is a critical element in youth education, as it facilitates learners to understand and realize the importance of creating a sustainable future for themselves and others. Changing learner attitudes and related behaviours is critical in ESE. Digital game-based learning (DGBL) environments offer a suitable pedagogical tool for ESE, as they enable youth to learn and test their behaviours within the game. This literature review looks at studies that examine the efficacy  
of games as a pedagogical tool for producing change in attitudes and behaviours regarding environmental sustainability. While there are limited longitudinal studies that test whether learners retained their environmentfriendly behaviours over time, which highlights the need for more such  
research; existing studies do show that games have demonstrated the potential for producing attitudinal change.

# The art of gamification; Teaching sustainability and system thinking by pervasive game development.

Abstract: In 2013 Hedmark University College conducted a research project where students from a game development project/study program developed and tested a Pervasive Game for learning as part of a class in System Thinking. The overall game goal was to teach Sustainability through System Thinking, and to give the students a real world experience with their game;. It was tested on 5th and 7th graders in elementary school, spending one school day in each of the classes. This article focuses on the design of the project: how the game was developed, how the children played it and how  
research was designed and data collected.

ABSTRACT  
Critical thinking and other higher-order thinking skills are key objectives of higher education. Through the development of higher-order thinking skills, students are able to discern information from multiple,  
often competing sources, make sound judgements, draw conclusions, and enact creative solutions to complex problems. However, faculty can struggle with how to help students develop higher-order thinking skills, relying instead on transmission of knowledge, focusing on what to learn instead of how to learn. In this chapter, the author provides insights into the connections between using gamification as  
a pedagogical approach, and the development of higher-order thinking skills. The chapter addresses perspectives on higher-ordering thinking, approaches to gamification in college courses, and concludes  
with recommendations for faculty in approaching gamification.

# No-till management impacts on crop productivity, carbon input and soil carbon sequestration

#### Author: Stephen M. Ogle a b  Amy Swan a Keith Paustian a c

## Abstract

The efficacy of no-till agriculture for increasing C in soils has been questioned in recent studies. This is a serious issue after many publications and reports during the last two decades have recommended no-till as a practice to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through soil C sequestration. Our objective was to investigate the possibility that the lack of C increase in some no-till systems may be due to changes in crop productivity and subsequent C input to soils. A meta-analysis of 74 published studies was conducted to determine if crop production varies between no-till and full tillage management. The results were used to estimate the change in C input due to no-till adoption and the influence on soil organic C stocks at steady-state using the Century model. We found that crop productivity can be reduced with adoption of no-till, particularly in cooler and/or wetter climatic conditions. The influence varies, however, and crop productivity can even increase in some regions following adoption of no-till. In cases where crop production and C inputs decreased due to no-till, the potential reduction in soil organic C stocks was offset by a decrease in soil C decomposition rates, except in cases where C inputs declined by 15% or more. Challenges still remain for understanding the full impact of no-till adoption on soil organic C stocks, such as changes on C inputs in deeper subsurface horizons, the influence of variation in NT seeding methods on soil disturbance, and changes in SOM stabilization due to saturation limits in mineral soil fractions, which may further modify net C storage in soils.
