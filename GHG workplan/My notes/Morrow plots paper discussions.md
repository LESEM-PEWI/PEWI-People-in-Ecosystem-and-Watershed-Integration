for the morrow plots, the low planting density and the changes in tillage depth were associated with the decreasing SOC trend; over time, the scenarios analysis shows that a high planting density and N fertilization arrested this trend, but it was not a definite one as carbon started declining after 94 years. This is consistent with the saturation model, where SOC inputs exceeds the soil carrying capacity of soils and starts declining.

they say that without considering these nuances, uniform agricultural management could lead to different outcomes for SOC in different locations.

initial SOC negatively influences SOC, but the interaction with the residue was not significant

The effects of residue removal on soil organic carbon (SOC) varied based on the nitrogen (N) rate. The different in SOC among the different combinations of residue retention and N application rate could be seen as potential trade-offs between environmental benefits for SOC sequestration and the end goal for residue removal such as producing cellulosic ethanol biofuel. While the trade-offs in SOC benefits are clear across different residue and nitrate rates, these suggests that discussions regarding the best strategy to harvest residue rate should consider the N application rates. This is because high fertilization tended to arrest soc loss when residues were removed on site.

Nitrogen fertilization influences residue biomass and the questions have been whether high high fertilization rate can offset soil organic carbon loss? Our analysis suggests that achieving a significant increase in soil organic carbon may not be answered by high N rates because they were was minimal difference from agronomicall optimal n rate with the high Nra

High inorganic nitrogen (N) increases microbial carbon use efficiency. This is the fundamental reason why splitting N application rate reversed the trend of soil organic carbon (SOC) from N and residue interactions. Generally the mean carbon and trends detected in this study suggests that fertilization has relatively little effect on SOC when applied in excess.

The decrease in residue content had a negative linear effect, as shown in Figure 3. This effect was because APSIM associated a specific reduction in residue with a certain portion of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool that cannot be replenished.

The low SOC benefits associated with high residue removal correspond to the assumption that APSIM links incorporated residue to the FOM pool  , and removed residue can not be incorporated into the soil. However, this pool is not physiochemically protected from degradation and can be attacked by microbial decomposition

Factorial simulations of N fertilization and residue retention indicated that for single fertilizer application, higher N fertilizer rates are necessary to maintain high SOC when less than 50% of residues are left on-site. However, with residue incorporation rates greater than 50%, higher fertilizer application rates did not maintain high SOC relative to the intermediate fertilizer application rate of 165 kg N ha<sup>\-1</sup>. For split N fertilizer application, higher application rates result in higher SOC than fertilizer application rates of less than 165 kg N ha<sup>\-1</sup>. These results can guide targeted residue harvest for other purposes such as second generation biofuels.

How Does the Interaction Between Initial Carbon Stock and Nitrogen Management Strategies Influence Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics in Corn Systems?

What Role Does Residue Management Play in Enhancing Soil Organic Carbon When Combined with Nitrogen Fertilization in Corn-Based Agroecosystems?

* * *

## Results

&nbsp;

Relationships between management practices, environmental variables, and changes in soil organic carbon (SOC).

The analysis presented in Table 4.5 highlights the interaction of soil physical factors such as Initial carbon content, Initial carbon to nitrogen ration and management factors such tillage, residue removal residue retention, N application strategy, on SOC dynamics in corn farming systems. The most notable finding is the strong negative correlation between initial carbon stock (IC) and changes in SOC, indicating that higher initial carbon levels are associated with reduced SOC accumulation or even losses. Conversely, nitrogen application and its interaction with residue management and application strategies exhibit strong positive correlations with SOC, implying that as residue and nitrogen increases so does the SOC content, intial soil organic matter C/N had no impact on SOC but its interaction with residue incorporation, removal and N application rate was significant. Residue removal had a negative effect on soil organic carbon as shown by negative spearman rank correlation coefficient and was very high when residues were incoporated at higher depth than at low depth.

emphasizing the importance of balanced nitrogen management and residue retention in enhancing SOC levels. Additionally, while some interactions, such as IC combined with nitrogen strategy (NS), negatively influence SOC, others, like the interaction between nitrogen and residue, positively contribute to SOC gains, underlining the complexity and interdependence of these factors in soil carbon management. These results underscore the need for integrated management practices that consider both individual and combined effects of various agronomic factors on SOC.

There was no signiifcant changes in the SOC benefits as driven by higher SOC above 244, the agronomicaly optimum rate. the difference in application strategy was significant at lower N rates than at higher rates.

# Data analysis

Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between various management factors (residue retention, residue removal, N application strategy, N fertilization), soil physical factors (initial surface organic matter carbon to nitrogen ratio, initial carbon content), and their interaction effect on the changes in SOC. Changes in SOC were calculated as the difference in the SOC between the start and end of the simulations (105 years). Spearman’s correlation coefficient (rho) measures a monotonic association, making it less restrictive than the Pearson correlation coefficient, which assumes a normal distribution of data (Yu and Hutson, 2024). The Spearman correlation was preferred over the Pearson correlation method because simulated data encompassing various interactions from different factors rarely conform to a normal distribution. In this type of test, the null hypothesis shows that both dependent and independent variables are independent of each other and lack a monotonic association. The management factors and soil physical properties were considered as the independent variables, and the change in SOC was the dependent variable. The sign of rho, positive or negative, between the independent and dependent variables, indicates the direction of association between the variables. A rho closer to -1 or 1 indicates a strong negative or positive association, respectively. The results of the bootstrapped samples (n=1000) were grouped and tabulated by the independent variables, along with their corresponding lower and higher confidence levels intervals. The medium percentile of the rho was plotted as bar graphs and sorted by the significance levels.

# Discussion

- The main drivers of changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) benefits were nitrogen as the most predominant soil management decision, followed by residue retention. This contrasts with Zhao's (2013) findings, which identified residue as the most dominant management practice. The discrepancy can be explained by the high residue biomass produced by corn driven by nitrogen fertilization. The interaction effect of residue and nitrogen fertilizer application rate on SOC benefits was substantial, as high residue incorporation and nitrogen fertilization prevented the decline in lower fertilization application rates. This implies that effective SOC management through residue harvest needs to align with the amount of biomass at the site, primarily driven by nitrogen fertilization.

    The analysis revealed a significant negative interaction effect between residue incorporation and initial carbon levels on SOC changes. On an individual level, residue incorporation had a significant positive correlation coefficient, while initial carbon had a strong negative correlation coefficient. This suggests that the expected benefits of residue incorporation for SOC enhancement may be diminished in soils with higher initial carbon stocks. This is consistent with experimental studies that have found SOC decline with increased residue incorporation under high initial carbon (Liu et al., 2014). The interaction indicates that high initial carbon may accelerate decomposition processes or reduce the efficiency of residue incorporation, leading to lower-than-expected SOC gains. These findings underscore the complexity of managing soil organic carbon, particularly in systems where initial carbon levels are already elevated, and highlight the need for tailored residue management strategies that consider existing soil carbon conditions to maximize carbon sequestration.
    
- &nbsp;
    
    Residue incorporation generally had a lower impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) compared to fertilizer application when considered on an individual level. This outcome can be attributed to the carbon saturation effect, where soils with substantial levels of organic carbon are less responsive to additional carbon inputs, such as those from residue incorporation. The potential for further SOC increase in these soils is limited because the soil has reached or is nearing its capacity to stabilize additional organic carbon. Residue removal, the inverse of residue incorporation, demonstrated negative impacts on SOC benefits. This is because, in the APSIM model, residue retention is closely linked to replenishing the organic matter pool, a critical component of SOC dynamics. Residue removal, therefore, signifies that a portion of the organic inputs that would normally contribute to sustaining or increasing the organic matter pool is instead removed, leading to a missed SOC gain. This underscores the importance of residue retention in maintaining soil health and carbon storage, as removing residues disrupts the natural replenishment cycle of organic matter.
    
- &nbsp;
    
    The combined effect of residue incorporation and nitrogen fertilization was higher than that of residue incorporation alone. This synergy suggests that nitrogen fertilization enhances the process of residue decomposition and integration into the soil organic matter pool (Kirkby et al., 2013), possibly by stimulating microbial activity or improving the overall nutrient balance, promoting greater residue production. Kimberly (2014) found that residue mass increased with increased nitrogen rate.  thus, this explains the high interaction effect of residue and N application. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering both nutrient management and organic matter inputs to achieve more effective SOC enhancement in agricultural systems.
