            <br>
            <p>
                People in Ecosystems/Watershed Integration (PEWI) is a simple web-based educational game designed to provide a scientific platform for teaching, discussing, and evaluating the tradeoffs associated with agricultural land use and management. Players iteratively
                manipulate land use annually for three years in a virtual 6000 acre watershed to meet a variety of goals. The tool computes a variety of results, including agricultural yields, soil erosion, stream pollution, and wildlife habitat.
            </p>
            <p>
                PEWI v4.1 is developed and maintained to be compatible with Google Chrome (versions 49+),
                Internet Explorer (versions 11+), Mozilla Firefox (versions 47+), and Safari (versions 9.1+).
