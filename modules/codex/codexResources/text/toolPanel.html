<p>The tool panel has seven features to use in designing your watershed.
  The Land Use tab includes 15 land cover options to use in your watershed,
  ranging from annual and perennial crops to pasture, forests, and native land cover.</p>

<p>The Precipitation tab shows the precipitation for each year.
PEWI simulates real life by choosing randomly from seven precipitation levels.
To override the presets, select a precipitation level from the drop-down menu.</p>

<p>The Years tab allows you to add another year of simulation to your watershed.
Some of the impacts of land use choices vary with weather or previous practices.
You can explore these effects by playing across multiple years.</p>

<p>The Indicator Tab includes overlay maps for Nitrate, Erosion, and Phosphorus risk.
You can edit the land use while in overlay mode to target a specific risk area.</p>

<p>The Physical Features tab includes five watershed behavior overlay maps displaying flood frequency,
strategic wetland areas, subwatershed boundaries, drainage class, and soil class.
You can edit the land use while in overlay mode to target a specific region.</p>
<p> The Yield Tab allows you to strategically place landuse types on the map, by providing information
for each yield type and their respective yield base rates based off soil type. To learn more about this feature,
check out the Yield Tab video.
</p>

<p>The buttons located above the Toolbar are for placing landuse types on the map. The leftmost button is the
individual brush, allowing you to paint one landuse type at a time. The middle button allows you to paint
multiple tiles at once by dragging and clicking the corners. The arrow button is the Undo button, allowing
you to undo previous changes. Any amount of previous changes can be undone. You can also undo changes by pressing
the "U" hotkey on the keyboard.
