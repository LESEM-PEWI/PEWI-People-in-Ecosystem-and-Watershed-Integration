<p>The tool panel has six features to use in designing your watershed.
The Land Use tab includes 15 land cover options to use in your watershed, ranging from annual and perennial crops to pasture, forests, and native land cover.</p>

<p>The Precipitation tab shows the precipitation for each year. PEWI simulates real life by choosing randomly from seven precipitation levels. To override the presets, select a precipitation level from the drop-down menu.</p>

<p>The Years tab allows you to add another year of simulation to your watershed. Some of the impacts of land use choices vary with weather or previous practices. You can explore these effects by playing across multiple years.</p>

<p>The Indicator Tab includes overlay maps for Nitrate, Erosion, and Phosphorus risk. You can edit the land use while in overlay mode to target a specific risk area.</p>

<p>The Physical Features tab includes five watershed behavior overlay maps displaying flood frequency, strategic wetland areas, subwatershed boundaries, drainage class, and soil class. You can edit the land use while in overlay mode to target a specific region.</p>

<p>The Brush tab includes two brushes for editing land use in the PEWI watershed. With the Hover Paint brush, you can click and drag to change the land use. With the Grid Paint brush, you can change an entire area. Click once to set the first corner of the grid and again to set the opposite corner. To switch the whole watershed to your current selection, double-click on the top left square. To randomize the land use, press “R” on your keyboard.</p>
