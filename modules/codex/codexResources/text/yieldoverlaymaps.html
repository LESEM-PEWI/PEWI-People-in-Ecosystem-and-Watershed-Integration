  The Yield Tab provides yield maps for different landuse types and some landuse types are under the same yield map
  and type. The different yield maps include: Corn Grain, Soybean, Mixed Fruit and Vegetables, Cattle, Alfalfa,
  Grass Hay, Switchgrass, Wood, and Short-Rotation Woody Biomass. Each yield type has a yield base rate based
  on soil type. The colors for each map on the map keys are the same colors as the ones on the maps
  to help the User to strategically place landuse types on the map. In addition to the yield base rates
  being on the Map Keys, Precipitation Tables are provided to show yield precip factors at different
  precipitation levels.
