  Specific information can be shown when hovered over tiles on the map. Each map when hovered over will display
  the tile's coordinates, the Land Cover that is currently being placed on the map, Precipitation level, and Soil Type.
  On some maps, there are some additional bits of information when hovered over. For the Nitrate, Erosion,
  and Phosphorus Maps, raw scores will show up that correspond to their map keys. Strategic Wetlands and
  Subwatershed Boundaries have their sections appear, while Flood Frequency, Drainage and Soil Class have their
  map key information appear. Yield maps all have their raw scores appear as well. Hover information displayed
  can be customized in the Instructor Options page and can be toggled on and off accordingly.
