  By pressing B, you can record your actions with PEWI. The record feature will keep track of all actions. When
  you're done recording, press B again to save what was recorded. If you want to see your recording, go back to the
  main menu and click on "Utilities", then "Run User Simulation" where you can upload your recording. Once clicking
  "Click here to begin Simulation", you can view your recording. A bar at the bottom left of the screen will show
  the recording's progress and it's possible to fast forward and rewind. Once finished, you can replay or return to
  the Main Menu.
