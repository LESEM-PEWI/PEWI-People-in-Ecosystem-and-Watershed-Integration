<p>The Prairie land cover in PEWI consists of a diverse mix of tallgrass prairie native to Iowa (Chennault 78). Less than 1% of historical 240 million acre extent of tallgrass prairie remains.<sup>[1][2]</sup> In Iowa, less than 0.1% of the original 30 million acres remain.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

<p>The native prairie ecosystem is a rich habitat for a diversity of organisms and provides many benefits through water filtration and retention, soil and nutrient retention, and carbon sequestration. Prairies also hold potential as a venue for tourism, recreation, and hunting (Chennault 52). Restored prairie may also be a source for valuable prairie seeds and native grasses for biomass.</p>
