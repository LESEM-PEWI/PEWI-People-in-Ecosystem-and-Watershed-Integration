  By pressing the Esc Key and going to Instructor Options, a list of Hotkeys is available with their default settings.
  However, the hotkeys can be customized and adjusted as much as possible, with the option of having two hotkeys
  per feature. You can also reset the hotkeys to bring them back to their default settings.
