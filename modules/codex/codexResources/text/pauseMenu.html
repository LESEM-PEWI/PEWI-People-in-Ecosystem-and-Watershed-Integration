While in the PEWI Workspace, hit the escape key on your keyboard to access the Pause Menu. From the pause menu, you can open this Index, access Options, or return to the Main Menu. The Options allow you to turn features on or off to customize the Workspace. Each land use can be enabled or disabled, and the number of years to edit can range from one to three. You can also enable or disable user edits to precipitation levels. These options are useful for creating a customized workspace setup for a classroom curriculum or other distribution purposes. If you download your watershed with custom option settings, these will be saved when the file is uploaded again.
