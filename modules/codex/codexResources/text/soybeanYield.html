Soybean yield is based on the ISPAID equation of Soybean Yield = .29 * Corn Yield. Total production is given by the product of the yield on a per-unit basis and the area of the grid cell, summed over the entire watershed.

Soybeans are the second-most-planted field crop in the US, with 77.5 million acres planted in 2009 (https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/soybeans-oil-crops/background.aspx).
