<p>Multiplayer mode allows you to partition the watershed for up to six users. After each user edits their portion, the files can be aggregated to view the results for the entire watershed.</p>

<p>Access Multiplayer Mode by selecting Utilities from the Main Menu. Choose “Set-Up Multiplayer” to load the PEWI Workspace. Use the icons on the left panel to partition land for up to six players. When you have completed your assignments, press V on your keyboard to download the maps as a zip file. Each player will have a separate file, which they can upload, edit, and download via Sandbox mode.</p>

<p>To view aggregate results for the entire watershed, use the Aggregate Multi-Maps tool on the Utilities tab.</p>
